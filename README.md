# Genetic_Algorithm_Parking_System
The aim of the project was to implement a genetic algorithm that controls the parking system of a four-wheeled vehicle and enabling computer simulation of this process. Algorithm implemented in the project was a non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II. The implementation was carried out in the PyCharm Community programming environment using Python.
